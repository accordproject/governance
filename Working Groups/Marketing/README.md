# Accord Project Marketing Working Group Documentation

A directory to store and track documentation and meeting notes for the marketing working groups.

## Meetings
All Accord Project meetings are run covered by the Antitrust Policy accessible [here](https://github.com/accordproject/docs#governance-documents-and-policies).

See the [Calendar of Public Meetings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=accordproject.org_gktijdpnstaltatqcv6bcvr54o%40group.calendar.google.com) for the next meeting and dial-in details.

Everyone is welcome to attend Accord Project meetings and provide technical contributions - you do not need ‘membership’ of any organization to submit a technical contribution or get involved.
