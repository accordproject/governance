# Accord Project Marketing Working Group Documentation

A directory to store and track documentation and meeting notes for the marketing working groups.

## Meetings
All Accord Project meetings are run covered by the Antitrust Policy accessible [here](https://github.com/accordproject/docs#governance-documents-and-policies).

See the [Calendar of Public Meetings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=accordproject.org_gktijdpnstaltatqcv6bcvr54o%40group.calendar.google.com) for the next meeting and dial-in details.

Everyone is welcome to attend Accord Project meetings and provide technical contributions - you do not need ‘membership’ of any organization to submit a technical contribution or get involved.

### Meeting Agendas
The agendas will be posted on [Slack](https://accord-project-slack-signup.herokuapp.com/) and recordings will be posted to the [Accord Project Vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/accordproject).
